# Adhd-task-tracker
A simple adhd task tracker 

I was recently got diagnosed with adhd and dyslexia 
i have issues with my short term memory and decided this would be a useful application for personal use

I used tkiner for displaying the gui
I used iconscout for the icon for the executable i got my iconscount subscrition as part of my github education benefits

Attribute to the author of the icon 
<a href="https://iconscout.com/icons/favorite-calendar" class="text-underline font-size-sm" target="_blank">Favorite Calendar</a> by <a href="https://iconscout.com/contributors/kiran-shastry" class="text-underline font-size-sm">Kiran Shastry</a> on <a href="https://iconscout.com" class="text-underline font-size-sm">IconScout</a>
